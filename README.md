Since the work with Jennifer on the SellBy project was so successful, youâ€™ve been tasked with another, larger project: analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

In this project, the **Automotive dataset** was selected for analysis. This analysis included using PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. PySpark was used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.
